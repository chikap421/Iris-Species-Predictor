# Iris-Species-Predictor

## Project Overview
The Iris-Species-Predictor is a machine learning application designed to classify Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project employs a logistic regression model trained on the famous Iris dataset and provides a Flask-based web interface for easy interaction.

## Features
1. Data Analysis: Utilizes Pandas for data handling and preprocessing.
2. Model Training: Implements logistic regression from scikit-learn for model training.
3. Web Application: Offers a Flask-based web interface for inputting flower measurements and receiving predictions.
4. Responsive Design: Ensures the web interface is user-friendly and adaptable to different device sizes.

## Installation and Usage
Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn, Flask, and NumPy.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run python Flaskmodel.py to start the Flask server.
4. Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the application.
